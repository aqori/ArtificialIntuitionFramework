# ArtificialIntuitionFramework

## Description

A hybrid neural network architecture combining graph attention mechanisms with hierarchical temporal convolution, optimized for efficient processing of multimodal sensor data in real-time edge AI applications.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for an Artificial Intuition Framework software project:
- "Utilizes graphbased neural networks for efficient pattern recognition and anomaly detection",
- "Integrates explainable AI techniques to provide transparent decisionmaking processes",
- "Employs transfer learning to adapt pretrained models to domainspecific datasets",
- "Leverages attention mechanisms to focus on relevant input features and reduce noise",
- "Supports realtime data streaming and incremental learning for adaptive systems",
- "Includes automated feature engineering tools for data preprocessing and transformation",
- "Provides modelagnostic interpretability tools for visualizing and understanding AIdriven decisions"
- Let me know if you need any adjustments!
